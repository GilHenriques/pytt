# pytt 0.1.0

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Added new functions (including `tic()` and `toc()` and `parallelize()`)

Note to self: I used `pytt 0.0.0` in a renv-managed project. I don't want any future changes to `pytt` to affect the project; changing the version number ensures the project will still run even if I modify the functions that were used in the project.
