**Pyttipanna** is a Swedish dish made by mixing together small bits and pieces 
of leftover food. The word means "small bits in a pan". Much like a pyttipanna,
`{pytt}` is a collection of bits and pieces thrown together. It includes very
simple utility functions that I use commonly. Most functions in `{pytt}` are
simply wrappers around other functions. 

## Installation

You can install pytt from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("GilHenriques/pytt")
```

## Functions included in `{pytt}`

### Binary operators

The package includes a series of binary operators that manipulate strings. 
These are wrappers around the base functions `paste`, `grepl`, and `substr`:

```{r example, echo=TRUE}
library(pytt)

# Paste operators: %_%, %__%, %._%, %,_%, %:_% (`paste`):
pytt_i_panna <- 'pytt i panna'
'Pytti' %_% 'panna is also called' %__% pytt_i_panna %._% 'It is a dish from Sweden' %,_% 'Denmark, and other countries.'

# Pattern-matching operator: %like% (`grepl`):
c('Pytt i panna', 'Pyttipanna') %like% '\\s'

# Substring (first or last few characters) operators: %left%, %right% (`substr`):
pytt_i_panna %left% 6
pytt_i_panna %right% 2
```

Some binary operators are not specific to strings:

```{r example2, echo=TRUE}
library(pytt)

# Negated %in% operator:
1:3 %!in% 3:5
```

Other functions include:

```{r example3, echo=TRUE}
library(pytt)

# Standard error:
se(1:5)
```
